*A Note on the 'Game' point:* Each hand, points ('pips' on Wiki) are awarded for collecting face cards and tens. Aces are worth four each, kings three, queens two, jacks one, and tens ten. The team with the highest total at the end of the hand is awarded the 'Game' point for that hand.


*Bidding:* Beginning with eldest hand, each player gets one chance to bid for the privilege of declaring the trump suit. A bid is the number of points that the bidder undertakes to win in the deal, the minimum bid being 1. Cinch, the highest possible bid, is a bid to take all four points but changes the score by 10 instead of 4. If a cinch bid is successfully made from a score of 0, the bidding team automatically wins the game (normally 11 points required). Each player must make a higher bid than the previous player, or pass. The only exception is that the dealer has the option to Cinch even if another player has already done so.


*Gameplay:* Winner of the bid leads to the first trick, and the winner of each trick leads to the next. First card led is trump. When playing to a trick, if a player still has cards left of the suit led, that player must either follow suit or play a trump. If the player is out of the suit led, any card may be played. The player who played the highest trump card to the trick wins it; or if no trump was played, the highest card of the suit that was led wins the trick.


*Scoring:* After all nine tricks have been played, the hand ends and points are awarded. If the bidding team makes their bid or better, they are awarded points equal to the number they actually took (so a team bidding 2 but winning 3 still gets all 3). The non-bidding team then scores any points they are entitled to.


If the bidding team does not make their bid, they are 'set' points equal to the bid (so a team bidding 3 and taking 2 is set by 3). The opposing team still scores for any points they took.


The first team to 11 points wins the game. If both teams reach 11 points during the same hand, the bidding team wins, even if that team has fewer points. (If team A is at 9 and team B at 10, and team A wins its bid of 2, with the other two points going to team B, team A still wins, 11-12.)
