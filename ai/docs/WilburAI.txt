This is my (Jack's) first AI. Its name is Wilbur.

This AI behaves "randomly."  When making plays, it will randomly select one legal play from its hand -- actually, it will loop through its hand and play the first legal card it encounters. But unlike RandomAI, Wilbur loops backwards (and therefore defaults to playing low cards).

During bidding, 60% of the time, it outbids the current highest bid every time.

Also unlike Mike's RandomAI, Wilbur likes to cinch. Unfortunately, he's not very good, so most of the time he fails. A game with four Wilburs would probably be a good way to test the MAX_HANDS functionality. Hmmm...

This agent provides enough functionality to be a full participant in a game, but calling it intelligent may be an overstatement.

It is certainly artificial.
