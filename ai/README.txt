 Instructions for adding AI modules

1) Copy one of the existing AI agent files (RandAI is a good choice) and rename to match your new AI's name. Do NOT use an existing AI name.

2) Open your file and change all the values in the description section. The AI_CLASS value MUST match the class name you will use for your AI agent.

3) Implement act() and handle_response() within your AI class.

4) Implement the rest of your AI. You can use other files as desired; the import paths should be relative to the root.

5) Open 'available_models.txt' and add the filename of your main AI class file on its own line.

6) (Optional but preferred) Add a documentation file in the docs subdirectory describing the important aspects of your AI.
